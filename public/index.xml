      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&#39;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&#39;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&#39;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&#39;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Alexis Ha ah48766 library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) happiness &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;2017.csv&amp;quot;) country_profile_variables &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;country_profile_variables.csv&amp;quot;) The country_profile_variable dataset provides information on 229 countries. This information includes population, surface area, GDP, life expectancy, rates of employment/unemployment, etc. The happiness dataset also provides information on countries around the world, some of which is not included in the country_profile_variables dataset, such as average happiness, freedom, government corruption, and family. These two datasets can be analyzed together to determine if there are any correlations between these variables and the average happiness of each country.</description>
