      <description>HELLO! My name is Alexis Ha. I am currently a 4th year Pre-Dental student at the University of Texas at Austin and am planning to graduate with a BS in Human Biology in May 2020. I was born and raised in the Lone Star State (Texas, yâ€™all!) in the Dallas metroplex, which will forever be my home. In my free time, I love spending time with family and close friends, as well as my dog!</description>
